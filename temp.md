Okay, I've reviewed the code snippet:

```javascript
function sum() { return a + b;}
```

Here's my feedback:

**Overall Impression:**

The code is a very basic function definition, but it has a significant issue: it relies on variables `a` and `b` that are not defined within the function's scope.  This will likely lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

**Specific Issues and Recommendations:**

1.  **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is intended to add two numbers, but it doesn't accept any input parameters.  It directly uses `a` and `b`, which are assumed to be in the surrounding scope (global or closure). This is bad practice.

    *   **Recommendation:**  Modify the function to accept parameters.

2.  **Undeclared Variables (Potential `ReferenceError`):**  If `a` and `b` are not defined in the scope where `sum` is called, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown.  Even if they *are* defined in a higher scope, it makes the function's behavior dependent on the external environment, making it harder to understand and maintain.

    *   **Recommendation:**  Avoid relying on variables from outside the function's scope. Pass the values as arguments.

3.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The code doesn't handle potential errors, such as the case where `a` or `b` are not numbers.  In JavaScript, adding non-numeric values can lead to unexpected results (e.g., string concatenation).

    *   **Recommendation:** Consider adding checks to ensure that the inputs are numbers, and handle the case where they are not (e.g., throw an error, return `NaN`, or attempt to convert them to numbers).  This depends on the intended behavior of your function.

**Revised Code:**

Here's a revised version that addresses the issues above:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    return NaN; // Or throw an error: throw new Error("Arguments must be numbers");
  }
  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
let result = sum(5, 3);  // result will be 8
console.log(result);

result = sum("hello", 3); // result will be NaN
console.log(result);
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Parameters:** The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`.
*   **Type Checking:**  The code now checks if `a` and `b` are numbers using `typeof`.
*   **Error Handling:** If either `a` or `b` is not a number, the function returns `NaN` (Not a Number).  You could also throw an error instead, depending on your requirements.
*   **Example Usage:**  I've included example calls to demonstrate how the function should be used and how it handles non-numeric input.

**Further Considerations (Depending on the Use Case):**

*   **Default Values:** If you want to allow calling the function with missing arguments, you can provide default values for `a` and `b`:

    ```javascript
    function sum(a = 0, b = 0) { // Default values of 0
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

*   **Variable Arguments (Rest Parameter):** If you want the function to sum an arbitrary number of arguments, you can use the rest parameter syntax:

    ```javascript
    function sum(...numbers) {
      let total = 0;
      for (const number of numbers) {
        if (typeof number !== 'number') {
          return NaN; // Or throw an error
        }
        total += number;
      }
      return total;
    }

    console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10
    ```

**Summary:**

The original code snippet has a critical flaw: it relies on undeclared variables.  The revised code addresses this by using parameters, adding type checking, and handling potential errors.  Remember to choose the implementation that best fits your specific needs and coding style.  Always strive for code that is clear, maintainable, and robust.
